### Recollection

Recollection has been built in Unity, using the Fungus library. Fungus makes use of flowcharts and facilitates narrative game play. 

Each scene in the game (e.g. kitchen, bathroom) has its own separate workflow. Within each workflow there are blocks, which contain say commands (for narrating a story), or menu commands (e.g. calling other blocks or workflows). Some blocks also contain variables (bedroom objects such as jumper, phone, book, necklace). These variables are of different types e.g. boolean, integer, etc. The blocks and flowcharts are traversed according to the order they’ve been set in. 

This game simulates a first-person experience grappling memories of romantic separation in visual novelesque style, with interactive objects and narrative literature. Inspirations are drawn by atmospheric story exploration games such as Marie’s room and Life is strange.

As the main focus of the game is unfolding the tale through exploring items, the objects are in a lighted space and easily identifiable. Both the narrative and each room in the game is uncharted territory where the player can discover audio and visual effects. Each scene reflects a stage of loss: denial and isolation, sadness, frustration and bargaining and finally acceptance.

This game walks us through those transitions to a closing phase marked by withdrawal and calm.
